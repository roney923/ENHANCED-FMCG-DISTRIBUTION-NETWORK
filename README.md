## Overview
Strategic business model for **HUL company-owned dark stores**, designed to:
- Compress lead time  
- Lift margins  
- Enable **30-minute direct-to-consumer (D2C) delivery**

**Key Components:**
- Company-owned dark stores  
- Direct farmer sourcing  
- Region-wise margin architecture  
 

---

## Executive Summary
- **Proposition:** Insert dark stores between super-stockist and distributor  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - Lead time reduction: up to **40%**  
  - Net profit margin improvement: **+15–20%** (blended GM 22% with private label)  
  - Freshness improvement: **+25%** via direct farmer sourcing  
- **Scope:** Urban micro-fulfillment in **Bengaluru**; last-mile delivery (own near-radius + contract EVs)  

---

## Problem Statement
- Fragmented multi-tier distribution → higher **lead time and cost**  
- Margin leakage via intermediaries  
- Weak quality & traceability of perishables  
- Region-level margin optimization underutilized  

---

## Strategic Pillars

| Pillar | Benefits |
|--------|----------|
| **Company-owned dark stores** | Control, speed, availability |
| **Direct farmer procurement** | Traceability, quality, freshness |
| **Region-wise margin architecture** | Profitability, competitiveness |
| **In-house D2C** | Customer data, loyalty, experience |

---

## Current vs Proposed Flow

**Current Flow:**  
`Plant → CFA → Super-stockist → Distributor → Retailer → Consumer`  

**Proposed Packaged:**  
`Plant/CFA → Dark Store → Consumer (D2C)`  

**Proposed Fresh:**  
`Farmer Cluster → City Cold Hub → Dark Store → Consumer`  

➡️ **Impact:** Fewer nodes → lower lead time, shrinkage, and cost-to-serve

## Proposed Distribution Network

Here’s the visual representation of the proposed model:

![Proposed Distribution Network](White%20Beige%20Minimal%20Flowchart%20Diagram%20Graph.png)


## Dark Store Blueprint
- **Size:** 1,500 sq ft; Ambient + Cold zones (2–8°C)  
- **Ops Window:** 06:00–23:00; order-to-dispatch ≤10 min; delivery ≤30 min  
- **Staffing:** 12–18 associates + supervisor per store; QC at pack-out  
- **Processes:** WMS, handheld picking, FEFO, cycle counts, OTIF >96%  
- **Safety/Compliance:** FSSAI, HACCP checks, IoT temperature alerts  

---

## Location & Assortment Strategy
- **Selection:** High-density residential clusters, 2–5 km coverage  
- **Core SKUs:** HUL packaged foods, personal & home care  
- **Daily Essentials:** Milk, eggs, fresh fruits/vegetables, staples  
- **Labeling:** “HUL Fresh” with QR traceability  
- **Availability Target:** >97% for top 200 SKUs  

---

## Direct Farmer Sourcing & Traceability
- **Flow:** Farmer → Collection/Grading → Pre-cool → City Cold Hub → Dark Store → Consumer  
- **Commercials:** 7-day payment, MSP + premium, quality-linked incentives  
- **Traceability:** Batch IDs + QR codes visible to consumers  
- **Fresh KPIs:** +25% freshness score, wastage ≤5%  

---

## 🔹 Region-wise Margin Architecture  

- **Inputs:** demand elasticity, logistics cost, store density, competitive intensity  
- **Base GM:** category-specific; regional overlay ±1–3%  
- **Dark Store Benefit:** unlocks incremental margins for retailers, ensuring stronger adoption  
- **D2C Uplift:** avoided trade discounts + faster inventory turns  

### High-Level Philosophy: Value-Sharing  
Efficiency gains are distributed across the value chain:  

➡️ **Retailers** → higher profit share  
➡️ **Distributors** → reduced inventory & logistics burden  
➡️ **Brands** → sustainable +15–20% net margin improvement  


---

## Last-Mile & Fulfillment
- **Fleet:** Own riders (near-radius) + contract EVs (3–5 km+)  
- **Routing:** Density batching, dynamic optimization, SLA ≤30 min  
- **QC:** Picker validation, pack-out QC, photo proof-of-delivery  
- **CX Target:** NPS ≥60  

---

## Technology Stack
- **Core:** ERP, WMS, OMS, farmer procurement/quality module  
- **Advanced:** Demand forecasting, replenishment engine, route optimizer  
- **Customer:** D2C app, WhatsApp ordering, CRM/loyalty  
- **Quality:** Traceability ledger, IoT audits, real-time dashboards
