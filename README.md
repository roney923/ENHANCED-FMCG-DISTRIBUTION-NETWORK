## Overview

This document outlines the strategic business model for HUL’s company-owned dark stores, designed to compress lead time, lift margins, and enable 30-minute direct-to-consumer (D2C) delivery.

**Key Components:**

- Company-owned dark stores  
- Direct farmer sourcing  
- Region-wise margin architecture  
- In-house D2C fulfillment  

---

## Executive Summary

- **Proposition:** Insert dark stores between super-stockist and distributor.  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - Lead time reduction: up to 40%  
  - Net profit margin improvement: +15–20% (blended GM 22% with private label)  
  - Freshness improvement: +25% via direct farmer sourcing  
- **Scope:** Urban micro-fulfillment in Bengaluru; mixed last-mile delivery (own near-radius + contract EV)  

---

## Problem Statement

- Fragmented multi-tier distribution increases lead time and cost.  
- Margin leakage through intermediaries.  
- Quality and traceability of perishables weakened by indirect sourcing.  
- Underutilized region-level margin optimization.

## Strategic Pillars

| Pillar | Benefits |
|--------|----------|
| Company-owned dark stores | Control, speed, availability |
| Direct farmer procurement | Traceability, quality, freshness |
| Region-wise margin architecture | Profitability, competitiveness |
| In-house D2C | Customer data, loyalty, experience |

---

## Current vs Proposed Flow

**Current Flow:**  
`Plant → CFA → Super-stockist → Distributor → Retailer → Consumer`  

**Proposed Packaged:**  
`Plant/CFA → Dark Store → Consumer (D2C)`  

**Proposed Fresh:**  
`Farmer Cluster → City Cold Hub → Dark Store → Consumer`  

**Impact:** Fewer nodes → lower lead time, shrinkage, and cost-to-serve  

---

## Dark Store Blueprint

- **Size:** 1,500 sq ft; Ambient + Cold zones (2–8°C)  
- **Ops Window:** 06:00–23:00; order-to-dispatch ≤10 min; delivery ≤30 min  
- **Staffing:** 12–18 associates; supervisor per store; QC at pack-out  
- **Processes:** WMS, handheld picking, FEFO, cycle counts, OTIF >96%  
- **Safety/Compliance:** FSSAI, HACCP-style checks, IoT temperature alerts  

---

## Location & Assortment Strategy

- **Selection:** High-density residential clusters, 2–5 km coverage, access to arterials  
- **Core SKUs:** HUL packaged SKUs (foods, personal/home care)  
- **Daily Essentials:** Milk, eggs, select vegetables/fruits, staples  
- **Labeling:** “HUL Fresh” with QR traceability  
- **Availability Target:** >97% for top 200 SKUs  

---

## Direct Farmer Sourcing & Traceability

- **Flow:** Farmer Cluster → Collection/Grading → Pre-cool → City Cold Hub → Dark Store → Consumer  
- **Commercials:** 7-day payment, MSP + premiums, quality-linked incentives  
- **Traceability:** Batch IDs + QR on pack, metadata visible to consumers  
- **Fresh KPIs:** +25% freshness score, wastage 3–5% max  

---

## Region-wise Margin Architecture

- Inputs: Demand elasticity, logistics cost, store density, competitive intensity  
- Base GM by category; regional overlay ±1–3%  
- D2C uplift via avoided trade discounts  
- Goal: +15–20% net profit margin improvement  

---

## Last-Mile & Fulfillment Model

- Mixed fleet: Own riders near-radius; contract EVs 3–5 km+  
- Density-led batching, dynamic routing, SLA 30 min  
- Picker optimization, QC at pack-out, photo proof-of-delivery  
- Customer Experience (CX) NPS target ≥60  

---

## Technology Stack

- ERP, WMS, OMS, Farmer Procurement/Quality module  
- Demand forecasting, replenishment, pricing engine, route optimizer  
- D2C app + WhatsApp ordering; loyalty/CRM; offers engine  
- Traceability ledger, QA audits, dashboards
